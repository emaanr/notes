# Key HTTP RFCs to Focus On

### RFC 9110 – HTTP Semantics

- This RFC defines the core concepts of HTTP that remain consistent across all versions (methods like GET/POST, status codes, headers, etc.).
- It's the backbone of HTTP, so understanding this first gives you a solid foundation.

### RFC 9111 – HTTP Caching

- This RFC focuses on caching mechanisms in HTTP, a critical part of web performance.
- Understanding caching before diving into individual versions helps you see how content delivery can be optimized.

### RFC 9112 – HTTP/1.1

- After grasping the semantics and caching, this RFC details the structure, syntax, and operations of HTTP/1.1.
- It introduces persistent connections and chunked transfers.

### RFC 9113 – HTTP/2

- This RFC introduces significant improvements like multiplexing, stream prioritization, and header compression.
- You'll see how HTTP evolved from its simpler 1.1 version.

### RFC 9114 – HTTP/3

- Finally, this RFC covers the most modern HTTP version built on QUIC, providing faster and more reliable connections.
- Reading it last helps you appreciate the challenges HTTP/3 aims to solve based on its predecessors.

# Other HTTP RFCs

In addition to the core HTTP RFCs you've already considered, several other RFCs provide valuable insights into specific aspects of HTTP and its related technologies. Here's a curated list to enhance your understanding

## Header Compression Mechanisms

### RFC 7541 – HPACK: Header Compression for HTTP/2

- Details the HPACK compression format used in HTTP/2 to reduce header size, improving performance.

### RFC 9204 – QPACK: Header Compression for HTTP/3

- Describes QPACK, the header compression scheme tailored for HTTP/3, addressing challenges posed by its underlying transport protocol, QUIC.

## Security Enhancements

### RFC 6797 – HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

- Introduces a mechanism enabling websites to declare themselves accessible only via secure connections, mitigating certain types of attacks.

### RFC 7469 – Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP (HPKP)

- Defines a method for HTTPS websites to resist impersonation by specifying which public keys are valid for a domain.

## State Management

### RFC 6265 – HTTP State Management Mechanism

- Standardizes the use of cookies for state management between clients and servers, essential for session handling and personalization.

## Protocol Negotiation

### RFC 7301 – Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

- Specifies a TLS extension for negotiating the application protocol during the TLS handshake, crucial for protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

## WebSockets

### RFC 6455 – The WebSocket Protocol

- Defines a protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data transfer between clients and servers.

## Conditional Requests and Range Requests

### RFC 7232 – HTTP/1.1: Conditional Requests

- Explains mechanisms like ETags and Last-Modified headers, allowing clients to make requests based on the state of a resource.

### RFC 7233 – HTTP/1.1: Range Requests

- Details how clients can request specific parts of a resource, facilitating resumable downloads and efficient media streaming.

## Authentication

### RFC 7235 – HTTP/1.1: Authentication

- Covers the framework for HTTP authentication, including challenges and responses, laying the groundwork for schemes like Basic and Digest authentication.

# Learn HTTP or Network+ Certification First?

It makes **perfect sense** to go in-depth into HTTP—**but when** depends on your goals and current skill level.

### If you're pursuing **Network+ certification**:

You should **focus on Network+ first** before diving deep into HTTP at the RFC level. Here’s why:

---

## ✅ **Why Network+ First**

**1. Network+ gives you critical context**
It covers foundational concepts like:

* The OSI and TCP/IP models
* Ports, protocols (like HTTP, FTP, DNS), and their roles
* TCP vs UDP, IP addressing, routing, and firewalls
* Basic security and troubleshooting
  This background helps you **understand the "why" behind HTTP** behavior and design.

**2. HTTP is layered on top of what Network+ teaches**
HTTP lives at the application layer. Without grasping transport and network layers (e.g., TCP, TLS, IP), going deep into things like QUIC (used by HTTP/3) or ALPN may confuse more than clarify.

---

## ✅ **When to Go Deep into HTTP RFCs**

**After Network+**, especially if:

* You're getting into **web development**, **backend systems**, **DevOps**, or **security**
* You're prepping for a **job interview** or **technical deep dive**
* You want to build **HTTP-compliant services**, proxies, caches, or debugging tools

---

## 📚 Your HTTP RFC List is Excellent — Here's How to Use It

Group your study **post-Network+** like this:

### **Start With:**

* 📘 **RFC 9110** – HTTP Semantics
* 📘 **RFC 9111** – Caching
* 📘 **RFC 9112** – HTTP/1.1
  *(Focus on connection reuse, chunking, status codes, headers)*

### **Then Continue With:**

* 📘 **RFC 9113** – HTTP/2 (Multiplexing, HPACK)
* 📘 **RFC 7541** – HPACK
* 📘 **RFC 9114** – HTTP/3 (QUIC)
* 📘 **RFC 9204** – QPACK

### **Optional but Great Additions (Post-core HTTP):**

* 🔐 **RFC 6797** – HSTS
* 🔐 **RFC 7469** – HPKP *(deprecated in practice, but good history)*
* 🍪 **RFC 6265** – Cookies
* 🔄 **RFC 7232 & 7233** – Conditional & Range Requests
* 🔐 **RFC 7235** – Auth
* 📡 **RFC 6455** – WebSockets

---

## 🎓 TL;DR Recommendation

* **Start with Network+**
* Then **move to HTTP RFCs** for deeper knowledge

You’ll be far more effective at absorbing and applying HTTP protocol knowledge **after** you've mastered the foundational networking concepts in Network+.
